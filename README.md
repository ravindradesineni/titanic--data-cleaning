ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset Cleaning
This project focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning of the Titanic dataset. It prepares the dataset for machine learning tasks by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical features, and removing outliers.

âœ… Steps Performed
Handling Missing Values

Imputed missing entries in features like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Encoding Categorical Features

Converted categorical columns such as Sex, Embarked, and Pclass using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding.

Standardizing Numerical Columns

Scaled features like Age and Fare using StandardScaler for uniformity.

Outlier Detection & Removal

Used the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to visualize and remove outliers from the dataset.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Core programming language

Pandas: Data loading and preprocessing

NumPy: Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Feature scaling with StandardScaler

Google Colab: Cloud-based notebook environment
